Release and installation of water level sensors on water barrel. Requests to:
```
GET http://192.168.4.1/water
```
return a response based on the water level detected:
```
{
  water: {
    level: empty | low | mid | full
  }
}
```

### Sensor

Three water sensors determine the water level in the water barrel. The sensors make digital readings (1 or 0) based on the detection or water. A reading at the three levels: low, mid or high as well as empty determines the current water level.

#### CQRobot Contact Water/Liquid Level Sensor

- Low Power Consumption
- Corrosion Resistance
- High Pressure Resistance
- High Temperature Resistance

An interface board that can be toggled between 3.3/5v converts the sensor reading to a digital signal.

### Installation

Installation of the sensors involved drilling holes in the water barrel based on the diameter of the CQRobot Contact water sensors. Due to the length of the sensor wires a water proof junction box was used to house the digital interface cards for each of the sensors.

Three LEDs were added to the breadboard for each of the possible water level readings. The LEDs will be used for debugging and removed with the next release.

### Learnings

Wire gauge (thickness) is important factor when considering the distance / length of the wire relative to the current and voltage that needs to be applied. In this case the gauge used was typical of Arduino projects but more research is needed to determine if a different gauge should be used. This should take into consideration the robustness needed for a long term outdoor environment.

Whenever a circuit is extended or rewired, or when any new circuit is installed, it is critical that the new wiring is made with wire conductors that are properly sized for the amperage rating of the circuit.
