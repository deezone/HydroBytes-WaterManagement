Release and installation of water irrigation functionality.

Requests to:
```
GET http://192.168.4.1/water
```
returns a status response based on:
- the current status of the water pump
- the water level detected
- the amount of time (in seconds) since the state of the pump has changed
```
{
  water: {
    level: empty | low | mid | full
    irrigation: {
      status: on | off
      duration: 000 (seconds)
    }
  }
}
```

```
GET http://192.168.4.1/water/irrigate?duration=xx&safety=disabled
```
returns the toggled state of the water pump. Parameter support for:
```
duration=xx (optional)
safety=disabled (optional)
```
- `duration`: the amount of time (in seconds) to irrigate
- `safety`: manage the safety check of the water level when irrigating to ensure there is water is available when the water pump is running

### Water Level LEDs
Fixed bug where each LED for each of the possible water levels was not turning on/off based on the related water level sensor reading.


### Pump Control with Relay
In order to control the on/off state of the water pump of ??v using a 5v digital pin on the Arduino Uno, a relay is used. The relay is a magnetic switch that can be turned on or off with a low voltage but manages the flow of a much higher voltage. The relay provides isolation to prodect the low voltage controllers when managing much higher voltage devices such as the water pump.


### Installation
@todo


### Learnings

On the Ardino board, the some of the digital pins are labelled with "~" which indicates "Pulse Width Modulation" ([Arduino PWM Tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/arduino-pwm-tutorial-ae9d71)). Digital pins are binary, on or off, 0 or 1. PWM adds the ability to simulate an anologue pin that can have a range of values (volatages) by turning the pin on and off with gaps resulting in an effective range of values that can be applied to things like LED brightness.
