### Two way serial communication - Adrunio Uno to ESP8266 ESP-01

This release adds important functionality on how to impliment two way serial communication. A request to GET /status includes confirmation that a two way serial connection exists and is working. The response to the request has a specific confirmation:

```
200
{
  status: {
  	"two-way-serial-communicstion": "true"
  }
}
```

or in the case of an error:
```
503
{
  status: {
  	"two-way-serial-communicstion": "false"
  }
}
```

### Root request updated

The root request; GET / has been updated to make room for a response that includes general information about the site.

```
GET /
{
  "hydrobytes-waters-station": "ok",
  "paths": {
  	"/": "Welcome message",
  	"/status": "Current state of subsystems"
  }
}
```

### Debugging
An important discovery of how to debug the the ESP-01 is to use the [USB to ESP8266 Adapter Module](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-ESP8266-Adapter-ESP-01S-Transceiver/dp/B07NWD1TQM) to toggle between PROG and UART mode using the switch on the board. After writing the updated code use UART mode and the serial terminal in the Ardunio IDE to mimic serial communication.

### Resources
- [Arduino Tutorial: Serial Inputs](https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2017/12/arduino-tutorial-serial-inputs)
An guide to possible applications for Serial input/output. This can be for debugging as well as communication between devices.

**Serial.available()** returns the number of characters (i.e. bytes of data) which have arrived in the serial buffer and that are ready to be read.

**Serial.read()** returns the first (oldest) character in the buffer and removes that byte of data from the buffer. So when all the bytes of data are read and no new serial data have arrived, the buffer is empty and Serial.available() will return 0.

**readStringUntil()** function, which makes it possible to combine all the characters in the sent message into a single Arduino string. In the case of `command = Serial.readStringUntil('\n');` the `\n` character, which is the newline character that comes at the end of a string sent in the Arduino serial monitor or with `Serial.println("TEST");`.
