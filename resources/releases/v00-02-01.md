# Release v0.2.1
24 October 2020

![v0-2-0-breadboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deezone/HydroBytes-waterManagement/master/resources/breadBoard-0-2-0.png)

Enhance water irrigation functionality with water level check.

Requests to:
```
GET http://192.168.4.1/water
```
and
```
GET http://192.168.4.1/water/irrigate
```
returns a status response based on:
- the current status of the water pump
- the water level detected
- the amount of time since the state of the pump has changed
```
{
  water: {
    level: empty | low | mid | full
    irrigation: {
      status: on | off
      duration: 000 (hh:mm:ss)
    }
  }
}
```


### Water Level LEDs
Fixed bug where each LED for each of the possible water levels was not turning on/off based on the related water level sensor reading.


### Pump Control with Relay
In order to control the on/off state of the water pump of 24v using a 5v digital pin on the Arduino Uno, a relay is used. The relay is a magnetic switch that can be turned on or off with low voltage but manages the flow of a much higher voltage. The relay provides isolation to protect the low voltage controllers when managing much higher voltage devices such as the water pump.


### Installation
Added dupont connectors to sensor lines to allow for easy disconnect from the breadboard. This allows the breadboard to be moved for upgrades.

### Learnings

On the Arduino board, some of the digital pins are labelled with "~" which indicates **"Pulse Width Modulation"** ([Arduino PWM Tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/arduino-pwm-tutorial-ae9d71)). Digital pins are binary, on or off, 0 or 1. PWM add the ability to simulate an analogue pin that can have a range of values (voltages) by turning the pin on and off with gaps. In effective a range of values can be applied to things like LED brightness.

More research needs to be done on the use of the **`String` variable type**. There appears to be a significant concern that it's use with microcontrollers should be avoided. Due to how it uses and manages memory performance and potential bugs are a concern. Initial efforts to move to a clearly defined buffer using the `char` variable type was used for the `irrigation_duration` response:
```
  char localbuf[9];
  sprintf(localbuf, "%02d:%02d:%02d", hours, minutes, seconds);
  Serial.println(localbuf);
```

Future versions that need event based functionality could use "Internal Timers". For example[the passing of a certain amount of time or when a pin changes state a certain amount of times could be a trigger. See [Internal Timers of Arduino](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/internal-timers-of-arduino-58f6c9).
