- [Library: DS3231](http://www.rinkydinkelectronics.com/library.php?id=73)
The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C realtime clock (RTC) with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal. The device incorporates a battery input, and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device as well as reduces the piece-part count in a manufacturing line.

The String class provides a convenient means to bring a Flash string into the RAM temporarily. Avoiding heap allocation is not always possible. Many Arduino cores (most notably the ones for ESP8266 and ESP32) put a very low limit on the stack size, so it’s not possible to put large strings there. In this case, using the String class makes perfect sense. Some libraries (for example ESP8266WebServer) force the use the String class.
- [Stack vs Heap: Know the Difference](https://www.guru99.com/stack-vs-heap.html)
  KEY DIFFERENCES
  - Stack is a linear data structure whereas Heap is a hierarchical data structure.
  - Stack memory will never become fragmented whereas Heap memory can become fragmented as blocks of memory are first allocated and then freed.
  - Stack accesses local variables only while Heap allows you to access variables globally.
  - Stack variables can’t be resized whereas Heap variables can be resized.
  - Stack memory is allocated in a contiguous block whereas Heap memory is allocated in any random order.
  - Stack doesn’t require to de-allocate variables whereas in Heap de-allocation is needed.
  - Stack allocation and deallocation are done by compiler instructions whereas Heap allocation and deallocation is done by the programmer.

The “heap” is the area of the RAM where the dynamic memory allocation happens.
