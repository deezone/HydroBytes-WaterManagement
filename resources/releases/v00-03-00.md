The DS3231 is a low-cost, extremely accurate I2C realtime clock (RTC) with an integrated temperature-compensated crystal oscillator (TCXO) and crystal. The device incorporates a battery input, and maintains accurate timekeeping when main power to the device is interrupted. The integration of the crystal resonator enhances the long-term accuracy of the device as well as reduces the piece-part count in a manufacturing line.

The String class provides a convenient means to bring a Flash string into the RAM temporarily. Avoiding heap allocation is not always possible. Many Arduino cores (most notably the ones for ESP8266 and ESP32) put a very low limit on the stack size, so itâ€™s not possible to put large strings there. In this case, using the String class makes perfect sense. Some libraries (for example ESP8266WebServer) force the use the String class.
