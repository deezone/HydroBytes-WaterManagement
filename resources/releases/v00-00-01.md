# Release v0.0.1

This release was a significant break through as to how to add wireless connectivity to the station.

In searching for a solution, it was discovered that there are many ways to approach adding WiFi to an Arduino micro controller. The most common is to access the wifi functionality on an esp8266. It is often confused that the two are separate controllers rather than an add on to the Arduino.

The esp8266, also a micro controller has wifi built in but also has a fully functional programmable controller as well as pin in/outs. There are many models of the esp8266, this release uses the most basic esp-01.

The solutions often use AT commands sent serially from the Ardunio to the esp8266 with it's default firmware. The AT commands setup and manage wifi communication. This proved to be a fragile arrangement as it depends on the serial communication being reliable. RS-232 communication should always have logic to deal with errors.

A more robust solution, used by this project is to flash the esp8266 with the Arduino library and use the dedicated packages:
```
#include <ESP8266WiFi.h>
#include <WiFiClient.h>
#include <ESP8266WebServer.h>
```
which adds all of the AT functionality.

Also a significant discovery that is a part of this release is the need for a stable 3.3v source for the esp8266. The 3.3v power pin on the Arduino Uno does not always provide sufficient voltage. Depending on what else the board is doing the level can drop. This causes the esp8266 to not function properly.

The solution was the use of a 3.3 voltage regulator. Using the Arduino Uno 5v source, the regulator converts the voltage to a stable 3.3v level.
